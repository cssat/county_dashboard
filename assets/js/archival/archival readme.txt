The files in this folder are the original custom (non-vendor) JavaScript assets associated with the county_dashboard project.

All of these custom assets were merged in the app.js master file, with the possibility that this large file may later be separated into small, more logical chunks.

Copies are retained here in case the original code needs to be referenced.

EXCEPTION: sparkline_2.js was a non-referenced (unused) variant of sparkline.js. The file cleaner (Brian Waismeyer) could not tell if it was an earlier version of sparkline.js or a new version that never got finished. It did not function properly when tested (broken formatting) and was not referenced by index.html, so it was simply moved to the archival folder and forgotten.
