## Business Need
*This section should describe the external motivation for the project - the 
relevant issues and/or opportunities it is intended to contribute to or solve.*
POC does not currently educate wombats.

## Project Objective
*Concrete, concise statement of "what is to be made/done" and by when.*
Build a dashboard - WombStat - that conveys key wombat welfare statistics and 
is integrated into the POC data site.

Target for completion is August 1, 2019

## Project Goal
*Purpose of the thing to be made/done. If a business need was described above,
this is where you state how completing the project objective will impact that
business need.*
WombStat should be a resource where internet literate wombats can get basic
wombat welfare information. It will both be a resource for educating wombats
and - since it will be part of the POC site - it will expand POC's internet 
footprint so that interested wombats are likely to find POC (and WombStat) when 
searching the web.

## Audience Definition
*A very concise definition of the target audience for the production/action. 
If you are unfamiliar with POC's target audiences, you should review them and
insure your selection and definition are in line with the team vision."
This is a tool targeted towards new sections of the General Public.

## Deliverables
*List of the concrete components that satisfy the objective.*
1. Standardized application structure and documentation
2. Necessary database updating/organizing complete
3. Data creation/flow complete and update schedule set
4. Integration of app into POC's current data tool collection.
5. Transition to advertising, testing, revision.

## Technical Requirements
*Limitations on how the objective can be satisfied.*
Must be completed with POC's current tech suite (R, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL)
and must be fit for integration with current tool collection and branding.

## Milestones
*Major steps in the process with soft/hard deadlines.*
April 1: Stakeholder agreement on project scope (objective, goal, etc.).
April 15: Mock-ups and tech strategy complete.
April 30: Prototype implemented. Stakeholder review.

## Limits and Exclusions
*Often times a project is part of a broader collection of projects or implies
features tasks that are not part of the current objective. Here is where such
confusions can be clarified.*
This project does not include advertising or full-scale usability testing in
its scope. These will likely need to be tackled after the project given
available resources/personnel.
